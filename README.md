Also, experiment with these in the following order:

* mqtt-LED-synchronous      - This is the first mqtt demonstration that looks similar to other examples online.
* mqtt-LED 					- This version supports robust reconnection as well as the ability for the loop to continue even if there is NO connection.
* mqtt-JSON					- This buildsupon the last demo by adding JSON support.
* mqtt-fire					- Our first FastLED/mqtt hybrid that support fire2012withpalette. If no connectivity, you still have fire.
