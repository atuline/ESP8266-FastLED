 * allfreq - What is the frequency
 * bgbri - The background brightness
 * bgclr - The background colour
 * startindex  - What foreground colour are we starting with?
 * thisbright - How bright is it?
 * thiscutoff - If the brightness is lower than this, then brightness=0
 * thisinc - incrementer to change the starting colour after each pass
 * thisindex - rotating colours down the strip counter
 * thisphase - the counter used in conjunction with the frequency to move down the strip
 * thisrot - How quickly to rotate those colours down the strip
 * thisspeed  - How fast does it whip down the strand
 * thisdir - Direction.
